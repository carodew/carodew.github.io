=================
Portfolio site, created in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

##Notes to self: 

To run locally: `jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve --drafts`

Toggle the baseurl in _config.yml as needed. 

Git is set to ignore all this so I don't share proprietary work in the remote site: 

*index-LOCAL-ONLY.html 
*_proprietary/
*img/proprietary/
*_posts/_proprietary/

Git will also ignore the old stuff I don't want anymore: 

*_removed
