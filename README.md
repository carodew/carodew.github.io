Portfolio site, created in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

## Notes to self: 

To run locally: `jekyll serve --config _config-local.yml` or `jekyll serve  --config _config-local.yml --drafts` 

Toggle the baseurl in `_config.yml` as needed. 

Git is set to ignore all this so I don't accidentally share proprietary work:

- `index-LOCAL-ONLY.html` 
- `_proprietary/`
- `img/proprietary/`
- `_posts/_proprietary/`

Git will also ignore the old stuff that I once thought was cool but is now embarrassing: 

- `_removed`

### Images

When I add a new project I need to add images. Specifically: 

- Thumbnail – represents the project on the homepage. 157 × 102
- Don't forget about the mobile view. That would be no bueno. 
- Project page – most images are 741 x whatever height. usually 402
