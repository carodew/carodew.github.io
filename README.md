=================
Portfolio site, created in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

##Notes to self: 

To run locally: `jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve --drafts`

Toggle the baseurl in `_config.yml` as needed. 

Git is set to ignore all this so I don't accidentally share proprietary work:

- `index-LOCAL-ONLY.html` 
- `_proprietary/`
- `img/proprietary/`
- `_posts/_proprietary/`

Git will also ignore the old stuff that I once thought was cool but is not embarassing: 

- `_removed`
