## Brief ##

The USAGov team within the General Services Administration is responsible for helping citizens and the general public better understand and interact with the federal government as a whole. They have been fulfilling this mission primarily by maintaining a [public website with information about government services](https://www.usa.gov), and by operating call center where people can call to ask questions when they don't know which agency to contact. 

With the use of search engines for finding information, people are less likely to browse through a static site to find information about government services. USAGov needs to adapt new strategies for meeting their mission. The [Federal Front Door discovery research](https://labs.usa.gov) was the first step in seeking to better understand how citizens interact with the government, and how they understand those interactions, to inform multiple experiments as USAGov seeks new models for fulfilling it's mission.

## What I did ##

* As part of a team of five researchers, conducted 45 user interviews in five representative cities across the U.S. to understand the publicâ€™s experience interacting with various government agencies.
* Consulted secondary research sources to both inform our process and add context to our own findings. 
* Helped develop a concrete research plan and conversation guides based on abstract framing questions (for example, "What touch points do people think they have with the federal government?").
* Collaboratively synthesized a large amount of data from raw interview notes and recordings using a grounded theory methodology. 
* Identified design opportunities for USAGov to explore through experimentation. 
* Created a print-friendly summary handout of our findings that can be delivered to senior bureaucrats, who are less likely to read a long report or follow a link to an online version. 
* Led and coordinated the collaborative writing effort of the entire team to create a cohesive research report that explores our findings in detail.
* Onboarded twelve employees to the project after volunteering to lead the project during the shift from discovery phase to experimentation.

## Results ##

Our research findings helped inform the direction of multiple high-profile projects, including the U.S. Web Design Standards, [vote.gov](https://www.vote.gov), experiments in cross agency information exchange, and other projects. In addition, the team was invited to present our findings to the Executive Office of the President (December 2015), and have responded to inquiries from a variety of foreign, state, and local governments.
