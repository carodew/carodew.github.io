## Brief ##

USAGov maintains [vote.gov](https://vote.gov), a small website that played a big role in the voter registration drives in 2016 and which was a White House priority. [Vote.gov](https://vote.gov) guides people to the voter registration materials in their state or territory, and became a trusted site for online corporations to link to as part of their own voter registration drives. 

USAGov approached us to help them make various improvements to the site, including tightening up the visual design, code, and content, and creating a Spanish language version. We also identified and fixed multiple accessibility problems and designed a better mobile experience.

## What I did ##

* Ran an accessibility audit and helped the team triage and address any problems found in order to comply with WCAG 2.0 AA standards and Section 508. 
* Our accessibility fixes also allowed developers to remove all JavaScript from the site, and created individual state-specific pages for direct linking. 
* Collaborated with various subject matter experts, stakeholders, and a cross-functional team to iterate quickly on interaction and visual design. 
* Co-created voter archetypes with an academic expert on voter behavior and identity, pulling from his expertise and guiding him through the design process. 
* Used a wide variety of techniques – including analytics, existing academic research, and task analysis. 
* Successfully advocated for a mobile-first approach after discovering that the vast majority of users visited the site on mobile devices – a far greater proportion of users than on most government sites. 
* Identified a major pain point for mobile users where some states only offered PDF forms, and proposed a range of possible solutions to the team. We ultimately chose the 'least effort' approach due to our limited time frame. 
* Adapted the visual design created for the Federal Front Door to the site design.

## Results ##

We successfully launched the redesigned site in time for Voter Registration Day and became the primary link for voter registration campaigns run by Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and other prominent sites. Sixteen states saw a 2 to 23 times increase in voter registrations from the day before the campaign.
