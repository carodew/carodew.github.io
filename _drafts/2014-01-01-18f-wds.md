## Brief ##

The U.S. Web Design Standards is an open-source pattern library and visual style guide to help government agencies quickly stand up accessible and responsive websites. Through early research, we learned that no existing front end framework or pattern library adequately met the needs of government workers, who needed something lightweight, easy to use, and accessible from the start.

## What I Did ##

* Conducted remote and in-person user and stakeholder interviews to surface goals, pain points, and needs 
* Conducted a comparative analysis of other public and private sector pattern libraries and front-end frameworks
* Conducted user and stakeholder interviews that informed overall product vision and strategy 
* Developed and maintained a set of user archetypes to represent government technology workers
* Conducted usability testing both with government tech workers who would use the library, as well as members of the general public who would ultimately find the patterns on government sites
* Contributed to MVP planning and identifying project milestones
* Wrote documentation for best practices in usability and accessibility
* Developed and executed a system for mobile testing and for prioritizing bug fixes 
* Conducted remote collaborative design sessions to prioritize feature development and releases

## Results ##

The [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) launched an alpha version in the fall of 2015 to wide acclaim. The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards) quickly became 18Fâ€™s most forked (over 500 copies) and starred (over 3,000 stars) project. Teams from various federal agencies have reported back on its ease of use, accessible foundation, and clean design, while also saving the team on development time. 

The standards have been used in projects for the Veterans Affairs Administration, the Office of Personnel Management ([USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov)), the Environmental Protection Agency ([epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov)), and [various other public and private sector organizations](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/staging/WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md).
