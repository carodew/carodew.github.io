## Brief ##

When a veteran disagrees with a VA decision on a benefits claim, they are legally entitled to appeal that decision. Caseflow is an enterprise web application that supports the workflows for handling these for the Board of Appeals at the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is composed of multiple sub-products that support different parts of a complex system for issuing decisions on appeals. The Caseflow team is made up of about 30 engineers, product managers, and designers, organized into smaller agile teams, led by a program manager, a product lead, an engineering lead and a design lead (my role).
When I joined the Caseflow team, they were a few months past shipping a large set of functionality ahead of a critical legislative deadline. Shortly after this deadline passed the U.S. Digital Service at the VA – who had been leading the effort – unexpectedly pulled out from the project. This left a leadership and skills gap on the team as well as eroded client trust.
The design team itself had been left undersized and under-skilled relative to the scope and complexity of the work. Additionally, as a subcontractor, Nava could not independently make hiring and staffing decisions to correct these gaps.

## What I did ##

* I provided coaching and mentorship to level up the skills of the designers on my team, while simultaneously advocating – internally and externally –for additional designers with more experience.
* I established a regular critique practice and delegated facilitation to help team members practice soft leadership skills.
* I developed frameworks and best practices for conducting and communicating user research.
* I created a presentation that better connected the day to day work with the mission of helping veterans to inspire the team across disciplines.
* I served as product owner for the design system, and helped transition the UI Kit to Figma, so the design team could better share and maintain common patterns and bake in best practices.
* I proposed and initiated design and research presentations as regular parts of the Board’s sprint review meetings, which were consistently well received. This helped build client trust as well as design team confidence.
* I helped transition design team practices when the entire team moved to a SAFe model to ensure design and research were not afterthoughts.

## Results ##

* Was able to grow the design team so that each junior designer was paired with a senior designer for leadership and coaching. Junior designers grew quickly in their knowledge and experience.
* Design team went from a period of feeling overwhelmed and burned out to a sustainable and stable workflow.
* Design system work codified a common set of patterns in a single source to be used throughout the application, moving the application towards more consistency in interaction patterns and visual design.
* Client trust improved and the contracting team consistently began receiving high evaluation scores from our government partners.
