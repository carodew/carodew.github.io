## Brief ##

USAGov maintains [vote.gov](https://vote.gov) (also known as [vote.usa.gov](https://vote.usa.gov)) a small website that was a White House priority. This site allowed social media companies to send users to an official government source to find voter registration information for their state or territory.

USAGov approached us to help them make various improvements to the site, including tightening up the visual design, code, and content, and creating a Spanish language version. We also identified and fixed multiple accessibility problems and designed a better mobile experience.

## What I did ##

* Ran an accessibility audit and helped the team triage and address any problems found to comply with WCAG 2.0 AA standards and Section 508. 
* Our accessibility fixes also allowed developers to remove all JavaScript from the site, and created individual state-specific pages for direct linking. 
* Collaborated with various subject matter experts, stakeholders, and a cross-functional team to iterate quickly on interaction and visual design. 
* Co-created voter archetypes with an academic expert on voter behavior and identity, pulling from his expertise and guiding him through the design process. 
* Used a wide variety of techniques â€“ including analytics, existing academic research, and task analysis. 
* Successfully advocated for a mobile-first approach after discovering that 70 percent of site visits happened on mobile. 
* Identified a major pain point for mobile users where some states only offered PDF forms, and proposed a range of possible solutions (with varying degrees of complexity) to the team.
* Adapted the visual design created for the Federal Front Door to the site design.

## Results ##

We successfully launched the redesigned site in time for Voter Registration Day and became a primary destination for voter registration campaigns run by Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and other prominent sites. Vote.gov became the top-most visited government site during Voter Registration Day. Sixteen states saw a 2 to 23 times increase in voter registrations from the day before the campaign.
