	<h2>Firehouse Broadcasting logo&nbsp;system</h2>
	<p>WFHB needed an updated logo set that showcased the communities it served and how to tune in. Inspired by Paula Scher&rsquo;s identity system for the New York Public Theatre, the individual station badges can be used separately or as part of the shield.</p>
