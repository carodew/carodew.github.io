	<p>
		<strong>Audience:</strong> Educators in college or starting out in their careers who need advice specific to the field of education.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Goals:</strong> Provide relevant, useful information to job-seekers within education, develop a relationship with both members and non-members of Pi Lambda Theta.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Constraints:</strong> This demographic makes heavy use of smart phones to browse the web and check email, so it was imperative that this design be responsive. This combined with the varying support of HTML standards across email clients meant the design had to be simple and straightforward. 
		<p>Using MailChimp&apos;s proprietary template language, this email template is easily updated by staff without an HTML background.</p>
