<h2>Wedding website design</h2>

As excited as I was to get married, I may have been just as excited to design all the pieces that go with a wedding. The Arabic calligraphy by <a href="http://www.arabiccalligrapher.com/">Josh Berer</a> translates roughly as &ldquo;A step without feet,&rdquo; a line from a poem by Rumi which we felt described our act of commitment. The line is repeated in English on the front page, written right to left as a nod to Arabic writing as well as to evoke a sense of the spiritual.
