PDK was using a website built on outdated code, and needed a future-friendly solution with a content management system and responsive design. 
We had existing internal research regarding our typical member profiles, mainly career educators working at the administrative or policy level. We also used web analytics to identify the most popular content.

Early on in the process we conducted a full content audit on the existing site, evaluating each page for attributes such as clarity, accuracy, scannability, value to user, and value to the organization. We made recommendations for each page and assigned each page a content owner. During this process we were able to reduce the total number of pages by about 25&nbsp;percent.

The content audit informed the overall site map. We organized content on the new site based on user tasks, grouped like pages together, and removed redundancies. We also streamlined user flows through the interactive elements of the site.

To communicate our preferences to our outside vendors I developed mobile wireframes to explore navigation options.
