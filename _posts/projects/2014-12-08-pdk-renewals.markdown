I worked with the Director of Membership and Marketing, Director of Member Services, and two outside vendors to create a new membership renewals campaign for this national professional association of educators. The campaign included multiple touchpoints, consistent branding, and built-in success tracking.

We realized we were working with an online renewals process that had evolved over many years and still had legacy functions in place. With many membership types and renewal processes, we needed to fully analyze the membership types, statuses (e.g. current, expired, etc.) and renewal functions to get a complete&nbsp;picture.

After we cross-listed all the renewal functions by membership type and status, we also looked at the current task flow for the most common user type, a person with professional membership who is not yet expired or up for renewal (an &lsquo;early renewal&rsquo;). We found that the process included more steps than were necessary and included a lot of unnecessary and confusing language.

Using the information from the initial analysis, I was able to revise the task flow for early renewals from seven original pages down to four. We also advocated internally to eliminate unnecessary fields from the renewals form and to prefill as many existing fields as possible.

This process happened concurrently with a complete website redesign that included a change in how we handled the member log-in. The two processes needed to be coordinated. With the new user flow in hand, I sketched out high view, low fidelity paper prototypes of the page layouts and navigation order for all scenarios. The team was able to use these sketches to pinpoint problems and refine the process before getting into design or development.

Once we had agreed upon the pages and steps for each user type, we could move into making high-fidelity prototypes for each page in the process and examining the content more closely. After collecting feedback from my coworkers and making refinements, we sent the HTML and CSS to the developers to help build the final product.

We also created a new email and direct mail campaign that began the renewal messaging earlier and allowed us to test key messages. I provided graphic design and the HTML/CSS for the email templates.
