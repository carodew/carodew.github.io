The Future Educators Association&nbsp;a career and college focused membership organization for high school students&nbsp;launched a flagship publication to bring ideas and concepts about the field of education to its members. 

I collaborated closely with the off-site editor-in-chief of the magazine to marry text and design into a format that appeals to high school students and their advisors. 

We worked on tight deadlines and with limited resources, so I made strong use of typography and layout to keep the designs fresh and exciting. We also utilized InCopy and InDesign to streamline our editing process and cut our production time in half. 

<i>Go Teach</i> won the Grand Award in the 2013 Communications Concepts APEX Awards, as well as various Awards of Excellence.
