Firehouse Broadcasting (call letters WFHB) is a community-run radio station serving various communities in south-central Indiana. While their main broadcast frequency was well known, they also broadcast their signal on a number of repeater-towers in various local communities, which were not as recognized. 

I helped them create an updated identity system based on their previous logo that both showcased the communities it served and their associated broadcast frequencies. Each badge can be used individually or as part of a unified badge.
