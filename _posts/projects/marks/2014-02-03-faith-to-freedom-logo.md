Faith to Freedom was a summer program co-produced by the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Happen, Inc. (an arts education nonprofit), and various area congregations. The program explored the role of faith in the fight for freedom from slavery. 

I created a program logo that typographically represented the relationship between the two concepts, as well as incorporating the flame icon from the Freedom Center's own logo.
