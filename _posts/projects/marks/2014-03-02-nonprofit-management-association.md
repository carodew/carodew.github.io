Although <i>U.S. News & World Report</i> consistently ranks the Indiana University graduate program in nonprofit management as the top program in the nation, the graduate student association didn't have a logo that reflected the professionalism and expertise of its&nbsp;members. 

I created a clean, contemporary mark that not only presented a polished identity for the group and tied into the brand colors of Indiana University to draw upon that connection.
