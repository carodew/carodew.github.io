BATO&mdash;a small, nonprofit dance organization&mdash;needed a lightweight sign to use outside a community space they rented once a week to host their classes. Since their schedule may change from time to time, they needed a way to easily update the information on the sign at minimal expense. 

I created the design using deep colors and strong diagonal lines inspired by those formed by tango dancers. Changing information can be filled in with chalk markers (indicated&nbsp;in&nbsp;green). Several levels of visual heirarchy allow passers-by to grasp the message of the sign in a glimpse, while providing important details to anyone interested.
