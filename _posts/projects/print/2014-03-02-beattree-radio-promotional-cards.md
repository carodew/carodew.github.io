This community radio program only aired during summers at a time that changed from one year to the next. These cards were passed out at local music events and venues in the spring to let people know the new airing times. The small size make them easy to slip into a pocket or wallet. 

I created a hand-drawn illustration that riffs off the format of program. Over the course of an hour, the host explores the work of local musicians, then branches out to include the songs of musicians who have served as&nbsp;inspiration.
