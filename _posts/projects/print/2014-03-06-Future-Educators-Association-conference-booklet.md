The Future Educators Association planned to celebrate its 75th anniversary at its national conference, where its members&mdash;high school students pursuing education careers and their adviser&mdash;congregate for national competitions, workshops, and presentations. The organization needed a booklet that not only celebrated the anniversary and explored its history and successes.

I worked closely with the association executive director, marketing director, and others to create a colorful brochure. I also visited the organization's archives in Washington, D.C. to uncover details and artefacts from the organization's past. From that trip I created a timeline and wrote a narrative of the organization's history that documents its growth, peak, decline, and rebirth.
