##Brief##

This nonprofit, professional association for educators had a membership renewal process that had evolved unchecked over many years. Due to staff turnover, no one person in the organization had a full understanding of the renewals process in place, and the organization failed to take advantage of many best practices. With many membership types and renewal processes, we needed to fully analyze the membership types, statuses (e.g. current, expired, etc.) and renewal functions to get a complete&nbsp;picture.


##What I Did##

I worked with a cross-functional team of staff and an outside development team to streamline the renewals process from the user perspective. I helped to identify our various user types and created story maps for the online renewal process, considering the entire renewal context with multiple touchpoints. By progressing from low-fidelity sketches and moving up to fully coded HTML mock-ups, I was able facilitate discussions about the user experience throughout the project, and iterate on the design based on feedback and new information. 

I created visual design for the direct mail and email campaigns, working closely with the marketing and membership director to unify copy and design. I also provided the HTML and CSS mock-ups for the development team. I also set up analytics to track our success.
