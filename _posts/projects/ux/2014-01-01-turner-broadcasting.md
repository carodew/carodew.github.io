##Brief##

Turner Broadcasting, Inc. uses custom software to predict how well future television shows would fare on its networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon&nbsp;Network, and Turner&nbsp;Sports. Estimates created in this system are the foundation for $4&nbsp;billion in advertising revenue per year. I worked on a team tasked with updating this software to better accommodate technological and industry-specific changes. 

##What I Did##

* Reviewed initial user interviews and analysis to get up to speed quickly working on a cross-functional, Agile (Scrum) team 
* Identified key UX objectives based on user feedback and team input
* Developed research priorities and protocols including usability tests, validating feature ideas, and contextual inquiry
* Advocated for user needs
* Facilitated collaborative design sessions
* Communicated design decisions with developers using a variety of rendering techniques&mdash;including wireframes, sketches, and interactive prototypes
* Developed a front-end pattern library (based on [the Atomic Design framework](http://patternlab.io/) by Brad&nbsp;Frost and Dave&nbsp;Olsen) to ensure consistent and clean styling
* During transitions, filled in for business analyst roles such as sprint planning, backlog management, and collaborative story writing
* Contributed to MVP planning and identifying project milestones

##Results##

This project is ongoing, but early user feedback has been positive. Users have said that the data are easier to read; the layout is more intuitive; and that the new version will not only be easier to use, but will help prevent costly mistakes. We are also implementing analytics to track progress along key metrics.
