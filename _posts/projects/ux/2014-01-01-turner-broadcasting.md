##Brief##

Turner Broadcasting, Inc. uses custom software to predict how well future television shows would fare on its networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon&nbsp;Network, Turner&nbsp;Sports, and others. Estimates created in this system are the foundation for $4&nbsp;billion in advertising revenue per year. I worked on a team tasked with updating this software to better accommodate technological and industry-specific changes. 

##What I Did##

I examined initial user interviews and analysis conducted before my arrival so that I could get up to speed quickly working on a cross-functional, agile (Scrum) team. Early on, I conducted a brain-storming session with the team to identify our key UX objectives&mdash;based on user feedback&mdash;for the application: 

* __Trust:__ Users trust the software application to calculate accurate numbers.
* __Clarity:__ Users understand how the software is calculating numbers and are able to find new insights into the data.
* __Speed:__ Repetitive tasks are streamlined and redundant tasks removed, application response time is quick. 

I facilitated collaborative design and white-boarding sessions within the team, and developed paper and interactive prototypes to test with users. I also conducted usability tests on the app in progress. 

When our business analyst moved on to another project I picked up many product ownership roles, such as sprint planning, backlog management, and story writing. I&nbsp;worked with a part-time business analyst and the lead developer on MVP planning and on identifying milestones.
