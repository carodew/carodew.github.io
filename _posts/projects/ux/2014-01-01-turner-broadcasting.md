##Brief##

Turner Broadcasting, Inc. uses custom software to predict how well future television shows would fare on its networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon&nbsp;Network, Turner&nbsp;Sports, and others. Estimates created in this system are the foundation for $4&nbsp;billion in advertising revenue per year. I worked on a team tasked with updating this software to better accommodate technological and industry-specific changes. 

##What I Did##

I examined initial user interviews and analysis conducted before my arrival so that I could get up to speed quickly working on a cross-functional, agile (Scrum) team. I conducted a brain-storming session with the team to identify our key UX objectives based on user feedback.

I developed research priorities and protocols and completed frequent user research on interactive prototypes and the actual application in development. I included members of the development team on user interviews and analyzed and shared results. I advocated for user priorities within the product team.

I facilitated collaborative design and white-boarding sessions within the team, and developed paper and interactive prototypes to test with users. I also conducted usability tests on the app in progress. I communicated design decisions with developers using a variety of rendering techniques&mdash;including wire frames, sketches, and interactive prototypes. 

When the team began to struggle with CSS layouts, I created a front-end pattern library (based on [the Atomic Design framework](http://patternlab.io/) by Brad Frost and Dave Olsen) to ensure consistent and clean styling and structure. 

When our business analyst moved on to another project I picked up many product ownership roles, such as sprint planning, backlog management, and story writing. I&nbsp;worked with a part-time business analyst and the lead developer on MVP planning and on identifying milestones. I established regular collaborative story-grooming sessions with the development team.
