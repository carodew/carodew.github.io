## Brief ##

PDK, a nonprofit professional association for educators, was using a website built on legacy code, and needed a future-friendly solution with a content management system and responsive design. 

We had existing internal research regarding our typical member profiles, mainly career educators working at the administrative or policy level. We also used web analytics to identify the most popular content.

## What I Did ##

* Served as project lead and organized a cross-functional, internal team
* Determined project strategies based on organizational goals and user research
* Created project milestones
* Led a full content audit on the existing site, evaluating each page for clarity, accuracy, &lsquo;scan-ability,&rsquo; value to user, and value to the organization
* Organized content on the new site based on user tasks and removed redundancies
* Re-imagined the PDK blog, shifting content from organizational information to current news and trends within education
* Led the team in creating guidelines for writing good web content, and coordinated the transfer of content to the new site amidst time-sensitive public campaigns
* Conducted training for support staff on the new website and changes it created for&nbsp;users

Analytics showed increased traffic to key areas of the website and we were able to implement analytics more effectively through the site. Through the content audit we were able to cut about 25&nbsp;percent of the site content. 

"[Carolyn's] ability to facilitate discussions about design, her knack at breaking down and simplifying complex processes, and her give and take of feedback has enabled her to create websites that are user-centered, streamlined, and effective." &mdash; [Jeanne Storm](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=49770690), Associate Executive Director 1999&ndash;2013, PDK International
