##Brief##

The Tri-Life Leadership Program is a mostly volunteer-run retreat that focuses on developing participants' natural leadership skills, yet had a minimal online presence. 

##What I Did##

I created a communications strategy and provided the organization with wireframes and sitemaps from a user-focused perspective.
