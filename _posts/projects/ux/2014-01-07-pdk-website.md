##Brief##

PDK, a nonprofit professional association for educators, was using a website built on legacy code, and needed a future-friendly solution with a content management system and responsive design. 

We had existing internal research regarding our typical member profiles, mainly career educators working at the administrative or policy level. We also used web analytics to identify the most popular content.

##What I Did##

As the lead in-house designer, I served as project lead and organized a cross-functional, internal team to work with an outside vendor that provided the visual design and development. I developed project strategies based on organizational goals and user research and led the entire development process.

Early on in the process I led a full content audit on the existing site, evaluating each page for attributes such as clarity, accuracy, scannability, value to user, and value to the organization. We made recommendations for each page and assigned previously orphaned pages a content owner. During this process we were able to reduce the total number of pages by about 25&nbsp;percent.

The content audit informed the overall site map. We organized content on the new site based on user tasks, grouped like pages together, and removed redundancies. We also streamlined user flows through the interactive elements of the site. 

We also completely re-imagined the PDK blog, shifted content from organizational information to current news and trends within the field of education.

As part of this process, I led the team in creating guidelines for writing good web content, and coordinated the transfer of content to the new site amidst time-sensitive public campaigns. I also conducted training for support staff on the new website and changes it created for users.

"[Carolyn's] ability to facilitate discussions about design, her knack at breaking down and simplifying complex processes, and her give and take of feedback has enabled her to create websites that are user-centered, streamlined, and effective." &mdash; Jeanne Storm, Associate Executive Director, PDK International (1999&ndash;2013)
