The University of Cincinnati has one of the oldest and most successful co-op programs in the nation, and features strong partnerships with many local businesses in the area. For the 100th anniversary of the program, they needed a commemorative booklet to give to various partners and stakeholders to celebrate the longevity of the program.

I worked with UC's in-house design team on the project, contributing the cover, page templates, typography, and layout of the booklet, for a look that is both modern and&nbsp;classic.
