Pi Lambda Theta was a collegiate-level honor society looking to reposition itself as a contemporary, career-prep organization for college students pursuing careers in education. Its long-standing publication, <i>Educational Horizons</i>, had lost touch with its audience. The editorial team relaunched the magazine with a focus on short, easily digestible articles focused on practical matters often overlooked in education programs. 

I created layouts and designs to express the content of the articles, collaborating closely with the off-site editor-in-chief. 

The February/March 2013 issue of <i>Educational Horizons</i> won an Award of Excellence for Illustration & Typography in the 2013 Communications Concepts APEX Awards.
